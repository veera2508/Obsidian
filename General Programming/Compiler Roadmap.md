I'd start with "Engineering a Compiler" by Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon (Third Edition has been published last year).

Incidentally, if we were still in the 1990s I'd say to not bother with the Dragon Book as it's an obsolete, mediocre intro to the basics of parsing theory and not a good example of a compiler book. In 2023 it doesn't deserve a further comment.

There's plenty of better resources that are more worthy of your time (see above)--I'd particularly recommend "SSA-based Compiler Design" ([https://link.springer.com/book/9783030805142](https://link.springer.com/book/9783030805142)) as follow-up text or "Static Program Analysis" by Anders Møller and Michael I. Schwartzbach ([https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/spa.pdf](https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/spa.pdf)) for a general background in program analysis (which may come in handy).
